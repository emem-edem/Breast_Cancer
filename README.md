Breast Cancer Data

**Objective** 

The objective of this project is to explore and visualize breast cancer data to uncover patterns and insights that can help in understanding the characteristics of malignant and benign tumours. By leveraging data visualization techniques, I aim to make the data more accessible and understandable for researchers, clinicians, and the general public. 

**Dataset**
I will use the [Breast Cancer dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) from scikiit learn . The dataset includes measurements for ten real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and others, along with a label indicating whether the tumour is benign or malignant.

Through these visualizations, I aim to:

Identify the most significant features that differentiate between malignant and benign tumors.
Understand the distribution and variability of tumor features.
Highlight potential patterns and relationships within the dataset that could inform future research or clinical practices.
